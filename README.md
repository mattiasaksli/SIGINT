# SIGINT
A local co-op puzzle game made with the Godot game engine.
The game was designed to be played on a Raspberry Pi 4 by 2-4 people using wireless controllers.
SIGINT was the result of my bachelor's thesis, [available here](https://comserv.cs.ut.ee/ati_thesis/datasheet.php?id=71662&year=2021).

Windows, Linux, Mac, and Raspberry Pi builds are also available for download there.
